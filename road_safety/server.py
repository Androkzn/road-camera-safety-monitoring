"""Live safety review API — the "brain" of the fleet-safety dashcam system.

Pulls a live stream, runs YOLO at 2 fps in a background thread, emits typed safety
events over Server-Sent Events with an LLM-generated one-line narration, and exposes
a RAG-backed copilot endpoint over a tiny statute/policy corpus.

=============================================================================
 MODULE OVERVIEW (for readers new to the codebase)
=============================================================================

This file is a FastAPI web service. It does THREE things in parallel:

  1. A background worker thread pulls camera frames and runs perception
     (YOLO object detection + a stack of safety "gates"). This is the hot
     path. See ``_on_frame`` and ``_run_loop``-style logic below.

  2. An asyncio event loop serves HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoints
     that stream live detections, expose admin controls, and offer agent /
     LLM features. See the ``@app.get(...)`` / ``@app.post(...)`` handlers.

  3. Several long-running background asyncio tasks (edge -> cloud publisher,
     retention sweep, score decay, watchdog) — all spawned in ``lifespan``.

KEY DOMAIN CONCEPTS
-------------------

  * GATES: a "real" conflict must pass several independent checks — depth,
    convergence, ego-relative motion, TTC (time-to-collision), and
    perception quality. Each gate kills a specific class of false positive.
    They are NOT removable; if you loosen one, noise spikes somewhere.
    See the gate order in ``_on_frame`` (numbered comments below).

  * EPISODE: repeated frames of the same risky situation for the same pair
    of tracked objects merge into a SINGLE event. The ``Episode`` class
    below accumulates peak severity across frames, then flushes ONE event
    when the pair hasn't been seen for a short idle window. This is how
    we de-duplicate across time.

  * PRIVACY INVARIANT (critical): license-plate text is hashed and STRIPPED
    at ingest inside ``services/llm.py::enrich_event``. ``server.py``
    additionally pops ``plate_text`` / ``plate_state`` at egress as
    defence-in-depth — see ``_emit_event`` below. Raw plate text must
    NEVER enter any in-memory buffer, SSE channel, Slack message, or
    cloud payload.

  * DUAL THUMBNAILS: every event writes two JPEGs:
        ``<id>.jpg``        — internal, unredacted (DSAR-gated access)
        ``<id>_public.jpg`` — redacted (faces + plates blurred)
    All shared channels (SSE, Slack, cloud) get ONLY the ``_public`` copy.
    The internal copy is served only to a caller presenting a valid
    ``X-DSAR-Token`` header.

  * AUTH TIERS (enforced per endpoint):
        public        — SSE, redacted thumbs, dashboard reads.
        X-DSAR-Token  — unredacted thumbnail retrieval (Data Subject
                        Access Request workflow).
        Admin bearer  — audit logs, LLM observability, road registry,
                        agents, retention, active-learning. The token is
                        read from the ``ROAD_ADMIN_TOKEN`` env var.
    Each HTTP endpoint's docstring below is labelled with its tier.

PYTHON IDIOMS USED IN THIS FILE (explained on first appearance)
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * ``from __future__ import annotations`` — defers evaluation of type
    annotations so forward references like ``list[int] | None`` work on
    older Python versions at runtime.
  * ``@asynccontextmanager`` (from ``contextlib``) — turns an async
    generator into a manager usable with ``async with``. FastAPI uses
    this for startup / shutdown ("lifespan") hooks.
  * ``async def`` / ``await`` — coroutines. They only run inside an
    event loop (here: the uvicorn asyncio loop). ``await X`` yields
    control back to the loop until ``X`` finishes.
  * ``asyncio.Queue`` — FIFO queue safe for producer/consumer across
    coroutines; used for SSE fan-out to subscribers.
  * ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)`` — schedule an async
    coroutine FROM a non-async thread (we use this to hand results from
    the perception thread back to the main loop).
  * ``threading.Lock`` — mutual exclusion so the perception thread and
    HTTP handlers don't read half-written frame state at the same time.
  * ``@app.get("/path")`` / ``@app.post(...)`` — FastAPI decorators that
    register the function below as an HTTP route.
  * ``Request`` / ``StreamingResponse`` / ``FileResponse`` /
    ``HTTPException`` — FastAPI primitives: request object, chunked
    streaming response body, static file response, and the exception
    that converts into an HTTP error.
  * f-string (``f"text {var}"``) — inline string interpolation.
  * ``list[X] | None`` / ``dict[K, V]`` — PEP 604 union + PEP 585 generics.
  * Comprehensions (``[x for x in xs if ...]``) — compact list/dict/set
    construction.
  * ``try/except/finally`` — exception handling with an always-run
    ``finally`` block.
  * Module-level ``state = LiveState()`` — a single process-wide singleton
    holding the live perception state. Do NOT create a second one.

# ===== SECTION: IMPORTS DONE. LOGGING CONFIGURED. =====
# Everything above is pure wiring — bring the dependencies into scope and
# configure structured logging (``setup_logging``) so every module uses the
# same formatter. ``log`` is a module-scoped logger; never ``print``.

# ===== SECTION: FLEET IDENTITY RESOLUTION =====
# Events are meaningless to downstream fleet analytics if they can't be
# attributed to a specific vehicle / road / driver. We resolve identity ONCE
# at import time; the results are frozen into module-level constants below
# and stamped onto every emitted event in ``_flush_episode``.


# Resolved fleet identity — every emitted event MUST carry a non-empty
# vehicle_id / road_id / driver_id or downstream fleet aggregation is
# broken (events appear as "unidentified"). If the operator didn't set the
# env vars, fall back to a stable hostname-derived default and warn loudly
# at startup so the deployment is obviously misconfigured instead of
# silently producing unattributable events.

    hostname-derived placeholder so events still emit — but also records
    the missing env-var names so ``lifespan`` can log a loud warning.

# jitter spikes through as "high"; raising ``MIN_HIGH_RISK_EPISODE_SEC``
# above ~1s starts missing real short-lived collisions (motorbike cut-ins).

                                         thresholds when perception is poor.
        3. ``EgoMotionEstimator``      — optical-flow ego speed proxy.
        4. ``SceneContextClassifier``  — urban / highway / parking tag;
                                         produces ``AdaptiveThresholds`` so

                                         traffic (``tracks_converging``).

                                         approaching in ego-relative space;
                                         otherwise TTC is bbox noise.
       10. Pair TTC (fallback: per-object) — SSAM-style closing-rate TTC.
       11. Approach-required TTC scrub — if no track is approaching, discard
                                         the TTC value (keep distance gates).
       12. Quality-adjusted classification — divide by QualityMonitor
                                         multipliers, classify with scene.

                                         emitted pairs until they clear.
