"""Demo GPS track — parses the bundled GPX file into a flat, loopable path
for the frontend map overlay.

Role:
    The demo dashcam MP4 replays forever (see ``StreamReader`` loop mode).
    We want an accompanying map tile that shows the "vehicle" moving along
    a plausible route while the MP4 plays. This module parses a GPX file
    (iPhone "Location Tracker" export, single ``<trk>`` with one or more
    ``<trkseg>`` children, each ``<trkpt>`` carrying ``lat``/``lon`` attrs
    and a ``<time>`` child in ISO-8601 UTC) into a single ordered list of
    ``(lat, lng, t_sec)`` waypoints and caches the result so every request
    reads from memory instead of re-parsing.

Why GPX (and a flat list):
    The iPhone Location Tracker app exports per-point absolute timestamps,
    which is exactly what ``load_track_for_window`` needs to align the map
    marker with a specific MP4's wallclock window. The loader walks every
    ``<trkseg>`` in the file and concatenates its points into one
    continuous loop, offsetting later segments so the total duration grows
    monotonically. That lets the frontend animate a single polyline and
    interpolate position by ``wallclock_sec % total_duration_sec``.

No ``from __future__ import annotations`` — we rely on the 3.10+ union
syntax at runtime (module is imported once at server boot).
