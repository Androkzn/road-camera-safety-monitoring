## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Road safety cameras generate massive video volumes that operators cannot review manually. Existing automated detection systems suffer from five production failure modes: false positive floods, LLM unreliability, privacy liability, silent model drift, and inability to scale beyond single-camera deployments. This platform addresses all five simultaneously with a modular, open architecture.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

- **Edge-first detection** using YOLOv8n + ByteTrack for real-time object tracking
- **Physical-unit risk classification** using time-to-collision and ground-plane distance with scene-adaptive thresholds
- **LLM enrichment layer** with multi-provider failover, rate budgeting, circuit breakers, and policy-gated external ALPR
- **Privacy-by-design** architecture: dual thumbnails, optional signed public-thumbnail access, plate hashing, DSAR gating, audit trail, auto-retention
- **Feedback-driven improvement** via drift monitoring, active learning, and operator verdicts
- **AI agent orchestration** with bounded tools, structured output, and hard iteration limits

### 1.3 Outcome

After ship:
- Operators see contextually-enriched, deduplicated safety events — not raw detection spam
- Shared event channels never carry raw plate text or unredacted thumbnails; any optional third-party enrichment path must be explicitly governed
- LLM failures are invisible to operators (graceful degradation)
- Model precision is continuously tracked with automated data curation for retraining
- Road managers have vehicle-level and driver-level safety dashboards
- AI agents provide on-demand coaching, investigation, and reporting

## 5. Current State (As-Is)

### 5.1 Existing Architecture Summary

The platform runs as a single-process FastAPI application with a background thread for video stream processing:

```
Stream → Detection → Tracking → Risk Classification → Event Emission → SSE/Slack/Edge Publish
                                                          ↓
                                                   LLM Narration/Enrichment
                                                          ↓
                                                   Operator Dashboard
```

### 5.2 Current Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Planned Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| In-memory event storage | Events lost on restart | Future: SQLite or PostgreSQL persistence |
| Single-process architecture | Cannot scale horizontally | Future: worker-based processing with message queue |
| No authentication | All endpoints are public | Future: JWT/OAuth2 middleware |
| No persistent database | Road registry resets on restart | Future: Redis or PostgreSQL for road state |
| CPU-only inference | Limited to ~2 fps | Future: GPU/TensorRT for real-time rates |

### 6.2 Ownership Boundaries

| Layer | Owns | Must Not Own |
|---|---|---|
| **Detection pipeline** (`detection.py`, `stream.py`, `egomotion.py`) | Object detection, tracking, TTC/distance computation | Risk policy decisions, LLM calls |
| **Risk engine** (`context.py`, `quality.py`) | Scene classification, threshold adaptation, perception quality | Object detection, event emission |
| **Server** (`server.py`) | Event lifecycle (episodes, emission, dedup), API routing | LLM logic, detection logic |
| **LLM layer** (`llm.py`, `agents.py`) | Narration, enrichment, chat, agent orchestration | Detection, risk classification, event emission |
| **Privacy layer** (`redact.py`, `audit.py`, `retention.py`) | PII redaction, audit logging, data expiry | Event semantics, risk classification |
| **Road layer** (`registry.py`) | Vehicle/driver state, scoring, aggregation | Event detection, LLM calls |
| **Observability** (`llm_obs.py`, `drift.py`) | Metrics collection, drift detection | Any mutation of events or state |
| **Edge/Cloud** (`edge_publisher.py`, `cloud/receiver.py`) | Event transport, integrity verification | Event semantics, modification |

### 6.3 Data Flow

1. **Frame capture:** `stream.py` reads frames from the live video source.
2. **Detection:** `detection.py` runs YOLOv8n inference + ByteTrack.
3. **Quality observation:** `quality.py` updates the perception state machine; degraded states tighten downstream multipliers and may skip vision enrichment.
4. **Ego-motion:** `egomotion.py` runs Farneback optical flow on the masked background to produce an ego flow vector + speed proxy.
5. **Scene context:** `context.py` classifies scene as urban / highway / parking / unknown and emits adaptive TTC + distance thresholds.
6. **Interaction discovery:** `find_interactions` enumerates candidate pairs from class membership and edge-pixel proximity.
7. **Pair gates:** for vehicle-vehicle pairs, the depth-aware proximity gate and convergence-angle filter discard pairs that are not real conflicts.
8. **Ego-relative motion gate:** TTC is discarded when neither track shows a positive approach residual against the ego flow estimate.
9. **Multi-gate TTC:** `estimate_pair_ttc` (preferred) or `estimate_ttc_sec` (fallback) returns a value only when sustained-evidence gates pass (monotonic growth, jitter-floor pixel delta, non-trivial track motion, scale ratio, closing rate).
10. **Distance estimation:** `estimate_inter_distance_m` returns 3D inter-object distance (depth difference + lateral offset).
11. **Risk classification:** `_classify_with_scene` ladders TTC > distance > pixel fallback against the scene-adaptive thresholds, then applies the speed-aware floor.
12. **Episode management:** per-pair episodes accumulate risk-frame counts and the peak-severity frame; on flush, `Episode.final_risk()` downgrades unsupported peaks.
13. **PII redaction:** `redact.py` writes dual thumbnails (internal unredacted + public face-/plate-blurred); plate text is salted-hashed before egress.
14. **LLM enrichment:** `llm.py` narrates the event and optionally runs ALPR only when policy permits (`ROAD_ALPR_MODE=third_party`), and skips on degraded perception or low-risk events.
15. **Event emission:** SSE to dashboard, tier-aware Slack dispatch (high-risk subject to the Slack quality gate; medium / low buffered), edge publish, road-registry update.
16. **Feedback ingestion:** `road_safety/api/feedback.py` receives operator verdicts.
17. **Drift update:** `drift.py` recomputes rolling precision and trend.
18. **Active learning:** `drift.py` selects decision-boundary and disputed events for relabeling.
19. **Agent invocation:** `agents.py` runs the tool-calling loop on operator request.
20. **Audit logging:** `audit.py` records all sensitive operations.
21. **Retention sweep:** `retention.py` expires old data on schedule.

## 8. State Model

### 8.1 Event Lifecycle States

| State | Description | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| DETECTING | Object pair is being tracked but has not yet passed all conflict gates | Detection pipeline |
| EPISODE_OPEN | Pair passed depth, convergence, ego-residual, and TTC gates; episode accumulates per-frame risk counts | Server |
| EMITTED | Episode flushed; `final_risk` computed (with possible sustained-risk downgrade) and dispatched | Server |
| COOLDOWN | Pair is in 8-second post-emission cooldown | Server |
| ENRICHED | LLM narration and/or vision enrichment completed | LLM layer |
| FEEDBACK_RECEIVED | Operator has submitted tp/fp verdict | Feedback service |
| SAMPLED | Event selected for active-learning relabeling | Drift monitor |

### 8.2 Allowed Transitions

| From | Event | To | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| DETECTING | All conflict gates pass for the pair this frame | EPISODE_OPEN | Depth gate, convergence filter, ego-residual gate, multi-gate TTC, scene-adaptive thresholds, low-speed floor |
| EPISODE_OPEN | Same-frame update | EPISODE_OPEN | Episode accumulates risk frame counts and peak frame |
| EPISODE_OPEN | Pair idle > `EPISODE_IDLE_FLUSH_SEC` | EMITTED | `Episode.final_risk()` computed; risk may be downgraded |
| EMITTED | — | COOLDOWN | 8-second timer starts |
| COOLDOWN | Timer expires | DETECTING | Same pair can re-trigger |
| EMITTED | LLM narration completes | ENRICHED | LLM available and rate budget OK |
| EMITTED | Operator submits verdict | FEEDBACK_RECEIVED | Valid event_id |
| EMITTED | Confidence in active-learning band or verdict=fp | SAMPLED | Active-learning sampler accepts |

### 8.3 Forbidden Transitions

- DETECTING → EMITTED (must go through EPISODE_OPEN — no skip-to-emit)
- COOLDOWN → EPISODE_OPEN (must wait for cooldown expiry, return to DETECTING first)
- EMITTED → EPISODE_OPEN (episodes are one-shot; new interaction = new episode)

### 8.4 Invariants

| Invariant | Enforcement | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Same (track_A, track_B) pair emits at most once per episode | `server.py` pair dedup dict | Duplicate pair within episode window → no double emission |
| Events in COOLDOWN never re-trigger for same pair | `server.py` cooldown timer (8s) | Same pair reappearing < 8s → suppressed |
| Public thumbnail never contains unblurred faces/plates | `redact.py` blur pipeline | `_public.jpg` file always has blur applied to person/vehicle regions |
| Plate text never appears in egress payload | `server.py` PII scrub | `plate_text` and `plate_state` stripped before SSE/Slack/cloud |
| Safety score never exceeds 100 or drops below 0 | `registry.py` clamping | Score clamped to [0, 100] after penalty/decay |
| Agent tool loop never exceeds 5 iterations | `agents.py` hard stop | Counter check per iteration |
| LLM rate bucket never allows > 3 req/min sustained | `llm.py` TokenBucket | Refusal before API call when bucket empty |

### 8.5 Idempotency / Retries

- **Event emission:** Each event gets a unique `event_id` (`evt_{timestamp}_{seq}`). Cloud receiver deduplicates on `event_id`.
- **Edge→cloud delivery:** At-least-once semantics with HMAC verification. Cloud ignores duplicate `event_id`.
- **Feedback:** Multiple verdicts for the same `event_id` are appended (latest wins for drift calculation).
- **LLM calls:** Retried through secondary provider on failure; result is cached per event (no double-narration).
- **Agent invocations:** Not idempotent by design (each invocation produces fresh analysis). Rate-limited at API layer.

## 10. Authorization, Privacy, and Security

### 10.1 Permissions Matrix

| Operation | Auth Required | Gate Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public endpoints (status, events, recent) | No | — | Operator dashboard view |
| Redacted thumbnails (`*_public.*`) | Optional | If enabled: `exp`/`token` query params (`ROAD_PUBLIC_THUMBS_REQUIRE_TOKEN=1`) | Audit-logged on success and denial |
| Unredacted thumbnails | Yes | `X-DSAR-Token` header vs `ROAD_DSAR_TOKEN` env | Audit-logged on success and denial |
| Feedback submission | Recommended | Reverse-proxy auth or API key (deployment-specific) | Audit-logged |
| Active learning export | Yes | Bearer `ROAD_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Audit-logged |
| Chat copilot | No | — | Audit-logged |
| Agent invocations | Yes | Bearer `ROAD_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Audit-logged |
| LLM observability / audit / retention / road summary | Yes | Bearer `ROAD_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Operational control plane |
| Cloud ingest | Yes | HMAC-SHA256 signature verification | `Signature` header |

### 10.2 Privacy Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Shared event channels exclude raw plate text | `plate_text` / `plate_state` stripped before SSE/Slack/cloud; unredacted thumbnails remain local except for optional enrichment integrations | `server.py` |
| Optional signed public-thumbnail access | `_public` thumbnails can require short-lived `exp`/`token` query params when `ROAD_PUBLIC_THUMBS_REQUIRE_TOKEN=1` | `server.py` |
| Face blurring | Upper 35% of person bbox Gaussian-blurred | `redact.py` |
| Plate blurring | Lower-middle strip of vehicle bbox blurred | `redact.py` |
| Plate text hashing | Raw text → salted SHA-256; salt per deployment | `redact.py` |
| DSAR-gated raw access | Token required for unredacted thumbnails | `server.py` |
| External ALPR policy gate | Third-party ALPR disabled unless `ROAD_ALPR_MODE=third_party` | `server.py` |
| Data retention | Auto-expiry: thumbnails 30d, feedback 90d, AL 60d, queue 7d | `retention.py` |
| Audit trail | All sensitive access logged with actor, timestamp, outcome | `audit.py` |

### 10.3 Security Controls

| Control | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HMAC-SHA256 signing | Edge→cloud payloads signed with shared secret | `edge_publisher.py` |
| Prompt injection defense | Image content marked UNTRUSTED; injection patterns detected/scrubbed | `llm.py` (OWASP LLM01:2025) |
| Rate limiting (LLM) | Token bucket (3 req/min) + circuit breaker (3 failures → 60s open) | `llm.py` |
| Input validation | FastAPI request body validation | `server.py` |
| Secret management | All secrets via environment variables; never hardcoded | `.env.example` |

---

## 11. Client Behavior and UX Technical Contract

### 11.1 UX / Interaction Rules

- Dashboard receives events via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- Events render as cards with risk badge (color-coded), thumbnail, narration
- Operator can click thumbs-up/thumbs-down to submit feedback
- Chat copilot is a text input that POSTs to `/chat` and displays the response
- Road summary is a read-only dashboard panel

### 11.2 Offline / Weak Network Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Dashboard loses SSE connection | Browser auto-reconnects; events accumulate server-side |
| Edge→cloud network outage | Events queue in local JSONL; drain on reconnect with exponential backoff |
| LLM API unreachable | Narration returns None; detection continues; events emit without narrative |

### 11.3 Caching and Staleness

| Dataset | Cache Location | TTL | Refresh Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recent events | Server in-memory (200 events max) | Evicted on overflow | New event pushes oldest out |
| Road vehicle state | Server in-memory | Persistent during session | Updated on every event/feedback |
| Drift report | Server in-memory | Re-computed on each feedback | `/api/drift` always returns fresh state |
| LLM metrics | In-memory ring buffer (5000 records) | Evicted on overflow | Computed on-demand from ring buffer |
| Thumbnails | Disk (`data/thumbnails/`) | Retention policy (30d default) | Deleted by retention sweep |

### 11.4 Accessibility and Localization Impact

- Dashboard: semantic HTML, color-coded badges with text labels (not color-only)
- All timestamps in ISO 8601 UTC format
- No localization required for v1.0 (English only)

---

## 12. Non-Functional Requirements

### 12.1 Performance

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Frame-to-event latency | < 2 seconds | Timestamp delta: frame capture → event emission |
| LLM narration P95 | < 3 seconds | `llm_obs.py` latency metric |
| Chat copilot P95 | < 5 seconds | `llm_obs.py` latency metric |
| Thumbnail generation | < 200ms | OpenCV encode time |
| SSE event delivery | < 100ms from emission | SSE push latency |
| API response (non-LLM) | < 50ms P95 | FastAPI response time |

### 12.2 Reliability

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Core detection uptime | 99.9% (LLM failures do not affect detection) |
| LLM enrichment availability | > 90% (with multi-provider failover) |
| Edge→cloud delivery | At-least-once (HMAC-signed, queued) |
| Data loss on restart | Zero for JSONL-persisted data; in-memory state resets |

### 12.3 Scalability

| Dimension | Current | Path to Scale |
|---|---|---|
| Vehicles per edge node | 1 | By design (single stream per node) |
| Edge nodes per cloud receiver | Unlimited (stateless ingest) | event_id dedup handles overlap |
| Events per second | ~2 (at 2 fps) | GPU inference → 30 fps → ~15 events/sec |
| LLM calls per minute | 3 (rate-limited) | Increase with paid tier |

### 12.4 Cost Considerations

| Component | Estimated Cost | Optimization |
|---|---|---|
| LLM narration (Anthropic Haiku) | ~$0.001/event | Skip for low-risk events; rate budget |
| LLM enrichment (vision) | ~$0.005/event | Skip when perception degraded; circuit breaker |
| Cloud hosting | ~$20/month (single node) | Edge-first reduces cloud compute |
| Cellular bandwidth (edge→cloud) | ~$0.10/MB | 2KB events vs 1GB raw video = negligible |

## 13. Observability and Analytics

### 13.1 Logging

| Log Event | Module | Metadata |
|---|---|---|
| Stream connected/disconnected | `stream.py` | URL, resolution, timestamp |
| Event emitted | `server.py` | event_id, event_type, risk_level |

| LLM down | Both providers failing > 5 minutes | Slack | Critical |
| High-risk event | risk_level = "high" | Slack (instant) | High |
| Vehicle safety score critical | score < 50 | Slack | Warning |

### 13.4 Analytics Events

| Event | Trigger | Properties | Source of Truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event_detected` | New safety event emitted | event_id, type, risk, confidence, scene | Server |
| `event_narrated` | LLM narration completed | event_id, model, tokens, latency_ms | LLM observer |
| `event_enriched` | Vision enrichment completed | event_id, plate_hash, readable | LLM observer |
| `feedback_submitted` | Operator submits verdict | event_id, verdict | Feedback service |

---

## 14. Testing Strategy

### 14.1 Unit Tests

| Component | Coverage | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| TTC computation | Correct TTC from bbox growth rates | `tools/eval_detect.py` |
| Distance estimation | Correct distance from focal-length model | `tools/eval_detect.py` |
| Scene classification | Correct scene from detection density + ego speed | `tools/eval_detect.py` |
| Risk classification | Correct risk level from TTC + scene thresholds | `tools/eval_detect.py` |
| Plate hashing | Deterministic hash; salt changes hash | manual test |
| Episode dedup | Same pair emits once; different pairs emit independently | manual test |

### 14.2 Integration Tests

| Flow | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Frame → Detection → Tracking → Event | End-to-end pipeline with test video |
| Event → Narration → SSE | LLM enrichment and dashboard delivery |
| Event → Edge Publish → Cloud Receive | HMAC signing, transmission, dedup |
| Feedback → Drift → Active Learning | Feedback verdict flows to precision and sampling |

### 14.3 Evaluation Harness (`tools/eval_detect.py`)

| Mode | What It Does |
|---|---|
| Single clip | Runs detection on a clip, compares to ground truth, reports P/R/F1 |
| Suite | Runs multiple clips, generates markdown report, detects regressions (>3% drop) |
| Compare | A/B comparison of two evaluation runs with delta highlighting |

### 14.4 Failure and Edge Case Tests

| Test | Scenario |
|---|---|
| LLM both providers fail | Verify detection continues; narration returns None |
| Empty video stream | Verify server starts without crash; endpoints return empty data |
| Malformed feedback | Verify 400 error returned; no crash |
| Concurrent feedback on same event | Verify both appended; latest wins for drift |
| HMAC signature mismatch | Cloud receiver rejects batch with 401 |
| Retention sweep on empty dirs | Verify no crash; returns zero counts |
| Agent max iterations | Verify hard stop at 5 steps; returns partial result |

### 14.5 Test Data and Environment

- **Test clips:** Stored in `data/test_suite/` with manifest JSON
- **Ground truth:** JSON files with labeled events per clip
- **Environment:** Local Python 3.10+ with `pyproject.toml` dependencies (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`)

## 15. Rollout, Migration, and Rollback

### 15.0 Phase Plan Matrix

| Phase | Goal | Included BRD IDs | Technical Scope | Dependencies | Exit Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Core detection + operator tools | BR-01 to BR-08 | Detection, tracking, risk, LLM, redaction, SSE, Slack, edge/cloud, chat | YOLOv8, LLM API | Events detected and narrated from live stream; Slack alerts fire; feedback accepted | Done |
| P2 | Observability + compliance + road | BR-09 to BR-14 | Drift, active learning, LLM obs, audit, retention, road registry | P1 complete | Drift report shows precision; audit trail logs access; road summary API works | Done |
| P3 | AI agents | BR-15 to BR-17 | Coaching, investigation, report agents | P2 complete | All three agents return structured results; max 5 iterations enforced | Done |

### 15.1 Rollout Strategy

- **Feature flags:** Each subsystem is independently toggleable via environment variables:
  - LLM: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `AZURE_OPENAI_*` (absent = disabled)
  - Slack: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (absent = disabled)
  - Edge publish: `ROAD_CLOUD_ENDPOINT` (absent = disabled)
  - Agents: Available when LLM is configured
  - Retention: `ROAD_RETENTION_*` env vars with sane defaults

- **Phased rollout:** Deploy edge node per vehicle → verify single-vehicle operation → add vehicles → enable cloud aggregation

### 15.2 Migration Plan

No data migration required for v1.0 (in-memory + JSONL storage). When persistent database is introduced:
- Schema migration scripts will be required
- Backward-compatible JSON event format ensures no breaking changes
- JSONL files can be bulk-imported into new storage

### 15.3 Rollback Plan

| Trigger | Rollback Action | Data Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Detection precision < 50% | Revert YOLO weights to previous version | None |
| LLM costs exceed budget | Set rate limit to 0 or remove API keys | Narration stops; detection continues |
| Privacy breach detected | Disable edge publisher; audit unredacted access | Events stop flowing to cloud |
| Agent producing bad coaching | Disable agent endpoints (remove from server routes) | No agent results; detection continues |

---

## 16. Operational Runbook (Day-2)

### 16.1 On-Call Guide

| Symptom | Likely Cause | First Action |
|---|---|---|
| No events emitting | Stream disconnected or YOLO model failed to load | Check `[server]` logs; verify stream URL; check `yolov8n.pt` exists |
| Narration always "None" | LLM API keys missing or both providers down | Check env vars; check `llm_obs` error rate; verify API key validity |
| Precision dropping | Data drift (new scene type, weather, camera angle) | Review drift report; check perception quality; export AL samples for relabeling |
| Slack alerts not firing | Webhook URL missing or Slack API issue | Check `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` env; test webhook manually |
| Edge→cloud delivery failing | Network issue or HMAC secret mismatch | Check edge node connectivity; verify `ROAD_CLOUD_HMAC_SECRET` matches on both sides |
| Audit log growing too large | Retention sweep not running | Check retention loop; trigger manual `/api/retention/sweep` with admin bearer token |

### 16.2 Manual Recovery Procedures

- **Restart server:** `uvicorn road_safety.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- **Flush edge queue:** Delete `data/outbound_queue.jsonl`
- **Reset drift state:** Restart server (in-memory state resets)
- **Force retention sweep:** `POST /api/retention/sweep` with `Authorization: Bearer <ROAD_ADMIN_TOKEN>`
- **Export active learning:** `POST /api/active_learning/export` with bearer token → returns zip path

### 16.3 Support/CS Notes

- Events are deduplicated per tracked pair — same pair emitting once is correct behavior, not a bug
- "No narration" on events is expected when LLM is unavailable — detection still works
- Thumbnails with `_public` suffix are safe-to-share versions; deployments can still require signed `exp/token` URLs
- Internal thumbnails require DSAR token (`X-DSAR-Token`)

## 20. Decisions Log

| ID | Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-01 | 2026-04-01 | Use YOLOv8n (nano) for detection | Must run on CPU at 2 fps; nano is smallest variant | YOLOv8s (too slow on CPU), YOLOv8m (much too slow) |
| D-02 | 2026-04-01 | LLM on metadata only (no video frames) | Cost: $0.005/frame vs $0.001/event; safety: no video in LLM context | Full video-to-LLM pipeline (too expensive, privacy risk) |
| D-03 | 2026-04-05 | Edge-first architecture | Privacy boundary: PII never leaves device; bandwidth: 2000x reduction | Cloud-first (bandwidth cost, privacy risk) |
| D-04 | 2026-04-08 | Salted SHA-256 for plate text | Enables cross-event correlation without storing raw PII | Encryption (key management overhead), discard (loses correlation) |
| D-05 | 2026-04-08 | Dual-thumbnail architecture | Structural guarantee: wrong thumbnail cannot leak PII | Single thumbnail with ACL (configuration error = leak) |
| D-06 | 2026-04-10 | Multi-provider LLM failover | Zero operator intervention during provider outages | Single provider with retry (single point of failure) |
| D-07 | 2026-04-10 | Self-consistency for ALPR | Eliminates hallucinated plates (15-20% error rate with single call) | Single call (cheaper but unreliable), no ALPR (loses value) |
| D-08 | 2026-04-12 | Three bounded agents (≤5 tools each) | 68% parameter hallucination when tool catalog > 10 | Single mega-agent (tool overload), two agents (insufficient separation) |
| D-09 | 2026-04-12 | 5-iteration hard stop for agents | Prevents runaway loops and cost explosions | No limit (risk of infinite loop), 3 (too restrictive for investigation) |
| D-10 | 2026-04-12 | Decaying penalty model for driver scoring | Score recovers over time; punishes recent events more heavily | Rolling window (loses history), cumulative (never recovers) |
| D-11 | 2026-04-15 | JSONL for audit/feedback/queue | Simple, append-only, no DB dependency; meets v1.0 throughput envelope | SQLite (overhead), PostgreSQL (infrastructure), Redis (volatility) |
| D-12 | 2026-04-15 | In-memory road registry with periodic snapshot | Operational state is reconstructible from event stream; avoids hard dependency on Redis/DB at v1.0 scale | Redis (adds infrastructure dependency), DB (premature for current scale) |
