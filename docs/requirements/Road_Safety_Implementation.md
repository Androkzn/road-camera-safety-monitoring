## How to Use This Document

This document is the execution handoff from the approved TRD into actual repository implementation.

- The approved TRD is contract-authoritative for behavior, state, API, auth, schema, privacy, and rollout truth.
- This document wins for repo-specific execution order, file plan, and implementation sequencing.
- If conflict exists between this document and the approved TRD → flag as Known Gap, resolve before coding.

**Workflow:**
1. Start at Phase 1 (core detection pipeline)
2. Complete phases in order — each phase lists its dependencies
3. Verify acceptance criteria after each phase
4. Move to the next phase

---

## Implementation Boundary

This document translates approved TRD contracts into repo-specific execution. It does not redefine:
- Feature scope or non-goals from BRD/TRD
- Behavior, state, API, auth, schema, or privacy contracts from TRD
- Cross-module boundaries defined in TRD §6.2

Belongs in this document:
- File-level change planning
- Phase sequencing and dependencies
- Module-by-module implementation detail
- Testing approach per phase
- Deployment preparation

### Deliverables

| # | File | Action | Description | TRD Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `stream.py` | CREATE | Multi-protocol video stream reader with frame queue | §6.3 step 1 |
| 2 | `detection.py` | CREATE | YOLOv8n inference + ByteTrack multi-object tracking | §6.3 step 2 |
| 3 | `egomotion.py` | CREATE | Sparse optical flow for camera-motion estimation | §6.3 step 3 |
| 4 | `context.py` | CREATE | Scene classification + risk threshold engine | §6.3 step 4-5 |
| 5 | `quality.py` | CREATE | Perception quality monitor (luminance, sharpness, confidence) | §6.3 step 5 |
| 6 | `server.py` | CREATE | FastAPI orchestrator: episode management, event emission, SSE, REST APIs | §6.3 steps 6-10 |
| 7 | `static/index.html` | CREATE | Operator dashboard with SSE event stream | §11.1 |
| 8 | `pyproject.toml` | CREATE | Python project metadata + dependencies | §3.3 |

### Implementation Details

**stream.py:**
- Thread-based video reader with queue-based frame delivery
- Supports YouTube Live (via yt-dlp), HLS, RTSP, and local mp4
- Automatic reconnection on stream failure
- FPS throttling to target processing rate

**detection.py:**
- Loads YOLOv8n model (`yolov8n.pt`)
- Runs inference on each frame; filters to relevant classes (person, vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, bus, truck)
- ByteTrack integration for consistent track IDs across frames
- Returns list of detections with `(track_id, class, bbox, confidence)`

**server.py — Episode Management:**
- Per-pair `(track_A, track_B)` interaction tracking
- Episode opens when TTC threshold is exceeded
- Episode accumulates peak severity across frames
- Episode emits on idle timeout (2s) or pair separation
- 8-second cooldown after emission prevents re-fire

**server.py — Risk Classification:**
- TTC computed from bbox scale growth rate between frames
- Ground-plane distance from focal-length model
- Scene-adaptive thresholds from `context.py`
- Risk bands: high (immediate danger), medium (monitor), low (informational)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Server starts and processes live video stream
- [x] Events are detected and classified with risk levels
- [x] Episode dedup prevents same pair from emitting multiple times
- [x] SSE endpoint streams events to dashboard
- [x] Dashboard displays events with thumbnails and risk badges
- [x] REST endpoints return event data and system status

---

## Phase 2 — LLM Enrichment Layer

### Prerequisites
- Phase 1 complete
- Anthropic API key and/or Azure OpenAI credentials (optional — system degrades gracefully)

### Deliverables

| # | File | Action | Description | TRD Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `llm.py` | CREATE | LLM client: narration, vision enrichment, chat with RAG | §6.2 LLM layer |
| 2 | `data/corpus/*.md` | CREATE | RAG knowledge base documents | §9.1 chat endpoint |

### Implementation Details

**llm.py — Narration:**
- System prompt with safety-analyst persona
- Event metadata (type, risk, TTC, distance, scene, quality) as structured input
- Returns 2-sentence narration; never sees raw video frames (TRD D-02)
- Graceful degradation: no API key → templated summary

**llm.py — Vision Enrichment (ALPR):**
- Thumbnail sent to vision model for license plate reading
- Self-consistency: two calls at different temperatures (0.0 and 0.3)
- Disagreeing reads → `plate_readable: "partial"` instead of guessing (TRD D-07)
- Circuit breaker: 3 consecutive failures → 60s open (TRD §8.4)

**llm.py — Chat Copilot:**
- RAG: loads markdown corpus from `data/corpus/`
- Semantic matching against user query
- Context window: corpus excerpts + recent events
- Returns natural-language answer

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Events are narrated with contextual LLM summaries
- [x] Vision enrichment produces plate hash when readable
- [x] Self-consistency check rejects disagreeing plate readings
- [x] Chat copilot answers questions using road policy corpus

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `redact.py` | CREATE | Face blur, plate blur, plate hash, dual thumbnails | §10.2 |

### Implementation Details

**redact.py — Dual Thumbnails:**
- Internal: `{event_id}.jpg` — full resolution, unredacted, local disk only
- Public: `{event_id}_public.jpg` — faces blurred, plates blurred, safe for egress
- External channels (SSE, Slack, cloud) always use public version

**redact.py — PII Protection:**
- Face blur: Gaussian blur on upper 35% of person bounding box (over-blur is correct failure mode)
- Plate blur: Gaussian blur on lower-middle strip (55-95% height, 15% inset) of vehicle bbox
- Plate hash: `hash_plate(text, salt)` → `plate_{sha256[:16]}`; salt from `ROAD_PLATE_SALT` env
- PII scrub in server: `plate_text` and `plate_state` stripped before SSE/Slack/cloud egress

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Every event produces both internal and public thumbnails
- [x] Public thumbnails have faces and plates blurred
- [x] Plate text is hashed with deployment-specific salt
- [x] Raw plate text never appears in any egress channel
- [x] Unredacted thumbnails require DSAR token

**edge_publisher.py:**
- Events queue in append-only JSONL (`data/outbound_queue.jsonl`)
- Background task reads queue, batches up to 20 events
- Each batch HMAC-SHA256 signed with shared secret
- POST to cloud endpoint with `X-Signature` header
- Exponential backoff on failure (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s max)
- Survives network outages — queue drains on reconnect

**cloud/receiver.py:**
- Separate FastAPI app on port 8001
- Verifies HMAC signature on each batch
- Deduplicates on `event_id` (set-based)
- Persists events to SQLite
- Returns 200 on success, 401 on signature mismatch

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Events are batched and HMAC-signed for delivery
- [x] Cloud receiver verifies signatures and rejects invalid batches
- [x] Duplicate event_ids are handled idempotently
- [x] Edge queue survives network outages and drains on reconnect

| 2 | `drift.py` | CREATE | Rolling precision, trend detection, active learning sampler | §13.2, §14 |

### Implementation Details

**road_safety/api/feedback.py:**
- POST `/feedback` — accepts `{event_id, verdict, note}`
- Appends to `data/feedback.jsonl`
- Updates drift monitor with new verdict

**drift.py — DriftMonitor:**
- Joins feedback verdicts with emitted events
- Computes rolling-window precision, sliced by risk level and event type
- Compares current vs prior window: "improving", "stable", "degrading" (±5% noise band)
- Minimum bucket size: 3 labels (avoids noisy 1/1 = 100% precision)

**drift.py — ActiveLearningSampler:**
- Decision boundary: confidence ∈ [0.35, 0.50] → sampled at 50% probability
- Disputed samples: verdict=fp → always captured
- Samples saved as JSON files in `data/active_learning/pending/`
- Export endpoint bundles pending samples into zip with manifest

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Operators can submit tp/fp verdicts on events
- [x] Drift monitor computes per-type and per-risk precision

  - High risk: instant Slack notification
  - Medium risk: batched in hourly digest
  - Low risk: batched in daily digest
- Rich message formatting with event details, thumbnail link, risk badge
- Graceful degradation: no webhook URL → alerts disabled silently

**digest.py:**
- Background schedulers for hourly and daily digests
- Aggregates events by type and risk
- Sends single Slack message with summary table

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] High-risk events trigger instant Slack notification
- [x] Hourly digest summarizes medium-risk events
- [x] Daily digest summarizes all events
- [x] No Slack webhook → alerts disabled silently

## Phase 11 — Evaluation Harness

### Prerequisites
- Phase 1 complete

### Deliverables

| # | File | Action | Description | TRD Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `tools/eval_detect.py` | CREATE | Precision/recall evaluation, suite runner, comparison | §14 |
| 2 | `eval_enrich.py` | CREATE | Evaluation enrichment utilities | §14 |
| 3 | `data/test_suite/` | CREATE | Test clip manifests and ground truth | §14.5 |

### Implementation Details

**tools/eval_detect.py — Modes:**

| Mode | Command | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Single clip | `python tools/eval_detect.py` | P/R/F1 per risk + per type |
| Suite | `python tools/eval_detect.py --suite` | Markdown report, regression flag (>3% drop) |
| Compare | `python tools/eval_detect.py --compare run_a.json run_b.json` | Delta table with highlighted regressions |

**tools/eval_detect.py — Metrics:**
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
- F1 = 2 * P * R / (P + R)
- Sliced by: risk_level, event_type, scene_type
- Regression threshold: >3% F1 drop from baseline

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Single-clip evaluation produces correct P/R/F1
- [x] Suite runner processes multiple clips and generates markdown report
- [x] Comparison mode highlights regressions exceeding 3% threshold
- [x] Results are saved as JSON for historical tracking

## Cross-Phase Rules

### Error Handling

- All modules use Python exceptions with descriptive messages
- FastAPI endpoints return structured JSON errors with appropriate HTTP status codes
- No silent failures — errors are logged with `[module]` prefix
- LLM failures are caught and return None (not raised as exceptions)

### Logging Convention

All modules follow the pattern:
```python
print(f"[module_name] descriptive message")
```

### Configuration

- All secrets via environment variables
- All tuning parameters have sane defaults
- `.env.example` documents all available variables with descriptions
- Missing optional env vars → feature disabled silently

### Security

- No PII in any log output or error message
- All external communications signed (HMAC) or over TLS
- Image content in LLM calls marked as UNTRUSTED USER DATA

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [x] All phases complete (status table shows SHIPPED)
- [x] Python syntax valid for all modules (verified via `ast.parse`)
- [x] No missing imports or circular dependencies
- [x] `.env.example` documents all environment variables
- [x] `pyproject.toml` includes all dependencies with version ranges
- [x] PII isolation verified (redact.py blur, plate hash, DSAR gating)
- [x] Audit trail covers all sensitive operations
- [x] Retention sweep deletes expired data
- [x] Episode dedup prevents duplicate emissions
- [x] Agent tool catalogs bounded at ≤5 tools each
- [x] Agent iteration hard stop at 5 steps
- [x] Multi-provider LLM failover tested
- [x] Circuit breaker and rate budget tested

### Deployment

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo>
cd road-safety
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with API keys and settings

# 3. Start edge node
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 4. (Optional) Start cloud receiver
uvicorn cloud.receiver:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# 5. Open dashboard
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify events are being detected from live stream
- [ ] Verify LLM narration is working (if API keys configured)
- [ ] Verify Slack alerts are firing (if webhook configured)
- [ ] Verify drift monitor initializes cleanly
- [ ] Monitor `/api/llm/stats` for error rate
- [ ] Submit test feedback and verify drift update
- [ ] Test agent endpoints with known event_id

## Known Gaps & Open Questions

| # | Area | Issue | Severity | Blocks Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Persistence | In-memory storage resets on restart | Medium | None | Accepted for v1.0 |
| 2 | Auth | No authentication middleware | Medium | None | Accepted for v1.0 |
| 3 | GPU | CPU-only limits to ~2 fps | Low | None | Future optimization |
| 4 | Multi-tenant | No tenant isolation | Low | None | Out of scope for v1.0 |
| 5 | Structured logging | Using print statements instead of structured logger | Low | None | Future improvement |

---

## Key Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | JSONL over database for audit/feedback/queue | Append-only, no external dependency; meets v1.0 throughput envelope; cleanly upgradable to SQLite/PostgreSQL when scale demands |
| 2 | In-memory road registry with periodic snapshot | Operational state reconstructible from event stream; avoids hard dependency on Redis/DB at current scale |
| 3 | YOLOv8n (nano) for detection model | Must run on CPU at 2 fps; smallest variant |
| 4 | LLM on metadata only (no video frames in prompt) | Cost: $0.005/frame vs $0.001/event; privacy: no video in LLM context |
| 5 | Edge-first architecture | Privacy boundary: PII never leaves device unredacted |
| 6 | Three bounded agents (≤5 tools each) | Prevents tool overload (68% hallucination rate with >10 tools) |
| 7 | Dual-thumbnail architecture | Structural PII guarantee vs single thumbnail with ACL |
| 8 | Salted SHA-256 for plate text | Cross-event correlation without storing raw PII |
| 9 | Self-consistency for ALPR (2 calls, different temps) | Eliminates 15-20% hallucinated plate readings |
| 10 | Decaying penalty model for driver scoring | Balances accountability with recovery over time |
